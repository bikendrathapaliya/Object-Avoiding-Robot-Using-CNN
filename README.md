# Obstacles-Avoiding-Robot-Using-CNN

## Introduction
Avoids obstacles and finds its way through it. A CNN model is used for autonomous control after model is trained. Use reinforced learning to reach its goal. This project implements a CNN and Q-learning to self-drive a robot. For reward, two modules are defined: (1) YOLO (2) Ultrasonic. YOLO was computing expensive so i discontinued it. It uses raspberry pi to control a robot, L298N to control dc motor driver. This project includes multiple files to train a model using reinforced learning, interactive model and train using images. It includes a simple android app and web page for futher easier control.
